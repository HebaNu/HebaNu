    "text": "Work From Home and Cityscape\nExperience the transformative shift in work dynamics worldwide. Fueled by factors like flexibility and propelled by the seismic impact of the Covid-19 pandemic, remote work, particularly Working From Home (WFH), has become a prevailing trend. This change in work culture is not merely a temporary response but a catalyst for a prolonged paradigm shift in workplaces globally.\nAs the emphasis on proximity to the workplace diminishes, individuals are opting for relocations to suburban areas, seeking affordable housing options without compromising living standards. This evolution in the work landscape intertwines with broader implications for cities—altering socioeconomic structures, reshaping urban landscapes, and influencing environmental dynamics.\nJoin us on this exploration of a dynamic era where work and living spaces converge, uncovering the profound effects of this transformative journey on cities, society, and the natural environment. Welcome to a new era in the world of work and living.\n\n\nDatasets Used\nSurvey Overview: The datasets for this survey focus on examining the profound impact of remote work on urban expansion and residential choices. Participants across various occupations have provided valuable insights through a comprehensive questionnaire. This data delves into working methods—remote or in-person—and their influence on housing location preferences. Additionally, it explores behavioral patterns relative to one’s working mode, shedding light on human-environment interactions and spatial dynamics.\nImportant Note: The datasets used on these posts are modified and synthesized, so they should be used solely for educational purposes and to demonstrate data analysis techniques.

    "title": "Decoding Work Patterns: Navigating the Remote vs. On-Site Landscape in Today’s Job Market",
    "section": "",
    "text": "As we navigate through the evolving landscape of the 2023 job market, we are witnessing a significant shift in work methods. More people are embracing Work From Home (WFH) while others continue with Work On Site (WOS). This post helps to understand how these work methods vary across different jobs in the USA.\nMy Approach: For this analysis, I’ve utilized the Naive Bayes classifier for multivariate Bernoulli models. This method is excellent for sorting jobs into two main categories: WFH and WOS. It’s a practical choice for my study because it efficiently handles binary data—like choosing between remote or on-site work.\nAbout the Data: The data comes from a 2023 survey of 850 participants from various occupations. Participants were asked about their industry sector and working method. To respect data confidentiality, we’ve modified and anonymized the dataset. This ensures compliance with data privacy guidelines without affecting the overall analysis and insights.\n\n\n\nThe survey participants from workers and their working method (WFH, or WON).\n\n\nIndustry Breakdown: The study categorized 20 main category for jobs according to the North American Industry Classification System (NAICS), aligning with the 6-digit Standard Occupational Classification (SOC) system from the U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics (BLS). Here’s a table of these industry sectors:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n#\nThe occupations categories are based on the 6-digit (SOC) system from the U.S. (BLS)\nIndustry Sector: Occupational Classification\n\n\n\n\n1\nNumber of jobs in NAICS sector 11\n(Agriculture, Forestry, Fishing and Hunting)\n\n\n2\ncns02 Number of jobs in NAICS sector 21\n(Mining, Quarrying, and Oil and Gas Extraction)\n\n\n3\ncns03 Number of jobs in NAICS sector 22\n(Utilities)\n\n\n4\ncns04 Number of jobs in NAICS sector 23\n(Construction)\n\n\n5\ncns05 Number of jobs in NAICS sector 31‐33\n(Manufacturing)\n\n\n6\ncns06 Number of jobs in NAICS sector 42\n(Wholesale Trade)\n\n\n7\ncns07 Number of jobs in NAICS sector 44‐45\n(Retail Trade)\n\n\n8\ncns08 Number of jobs in NAICS sector 48‐49\n(Transportation and Warehousing)\n\n\n9\ncns09 Number of jobs in NAICS sector 51\n(Information)\n\n\n10\ncns10 Number of jobs in NAICS sector 52\n(Finance and Insurance)\n\n\n11\ncns11 Number of jobs in NAICS sector 53\n(Real Estate and Rental and Leasing)\n\n\n12\ncns12 Number of jobs in NAICS sector 54\n(Professional, Scientific, and Technical Services)\n\n\n13\ncns13 Number of jobs in NAICS sector 55\n(Management of Companies and Enterprises)\n\n\n14\ncns14 Number of jobs in NAICS sector 56\n(Administrative and Support and Waste Management and Remediation Services)\n\n\n15\ncns15 Number of jobs in NAICS sector 61\n(Educational Services)\n\n\n16\ncns16 Number of jobs in NAICS sector 62\n(Health Care and Social Assistance)\n\n\n17\ncns17 Number of jobs in NAICS sector 71\n(Arts, Entertainment, and Recreation)\n\n\n18\ncns18 Number of jobs in NAICS sector 72\n(Accommodation and Food Services)\n\n\n19\ncns19 Number of jobs in NAICS sector 81\n(Other Services [except Public Administration])\n\n\n20\ncns20 Number of jobs in NAICS sector 92\n(Public Administration)\n\n\n\nGoal: My goal is to provide a clear and real picture of the changing work styles. I am not just analyzing numbers; I am uncovering the stories they tell about how people are adapting to new work environments, be it remotely or on-site.\nWhy I Chose the Naive Bayes Classifier for Multivariate Bernoulli Models:\nIn my exploration of work methods—remote and on-site—the Naive Bayes classifier for multivariate Bernoulli models shines with its simplicity and effectiveness. It excels at evaluating probabilities, helping determine whether a job is more likely to be remote or on-site based on its industry sector. This algorithm’s strength lies in its straightforward approach, providing clear baseline assessments that guide our analysis across different industry sectors. Dive Into the Code Behind the Analysis:\nx: The industry sector: [jobs categories From 1 to 20]\ny: The work method: 1 for WOS [Work on Site], 2 for WFH [Work From Home]\n\n\n\nCode\nimport pandas as pd\nfrom sklearn.model_selection import train_test_split\nfrom sklearn.naive_bayes import BernoulliNB\nfrom sklearn.metrics import classification_report, accuracy_score\nfrom sklearn.preprocessing import OneHotEncoder\nimport os\n\n# Load the dataset\ndf = pd.read_csv('C:/Users/NUSAI/Desktop/Machine learning/HebaNu.github.io/HebaNu.github.io/HebaNu/posts/Probability theory and random variables/updated_POST1.csv')\n\n# Drop rows where any cell is NaN in the 'Work Method' column\ndf = df.dropna(subset=['Work Method'])\n\n# One-hot encoding\nencoder = OneHotEncoder(sparse=False)\nX = encoder.fit_transform(df[[' industry sector']])  \n# includes 20 occupation types from NAICS for 6-digit SOC- U.S. BLS\n\n# Target variable\ny = df['Work Method']\n# 1 for WOS [Work on Site], 2 for WFH [Work From Home]\n\n# Split the dataset\nX_train, X_test, y_train, y_test = train_test_split(X, y, test_size=0.2, random_state=42)\n\n# Train the Bernoulli Naive Bayes model\nmodel = BernoulliNB()\nmodel.fit(X_train, y_train)\n\n# Make predictions and evaluate the model\ny_pred = model.predict(X_test)\n\n\n\n# Output the classification report and accuracy\nprint(classification_report(y_test, y_pred, zero_division=0))\nprint(f'Accuracy: {accuracy_score(y_test, y_pred)}')\n\n\n              precision    recall  f1-score   support\n\n         1.0       0.00      0.00      0.00        40\n         2.0       0.76      1.00      0.87       130\n\n    accuracy                           0.76       170\n   macro avg       0.38      0.50      0.43       170\nweighted avg       0.58      0.76      0.66       170\n\nAccuracy: 0.7647058823529411\n\n\nC:\\Users\\NUSAI\\anaconda3\\Lib\\site-packages\\sklearn\\preprocessing\\_encoders.py:972: FutureWarning:\n\n`sparse` was renamed to `sparse_output` in version 1.2 and will be removed in 1.4. `sparse_output` is ignored unless you leave `sparse` to its default value.\n\n\n\nInsights from Our Model: Understanding the Work Trends\nThe results from our BernoulliNB model offer fascinating insights into the current work trends. The model is predicting class 2.0 for WFH [Work From Home] with high precision (76%) and recall (100%), which means for this class, it performs well both in terms of the accuracy of the positive predictions it makes (precision) and its ability to find all the positive instances (recall).\nFor class 1.0, however, the model does not predict any instances correctly, which suggests that either there’s an issue with the distribution of your classes (perhaps class 1.0 is underrepresented), or that the features do not provide enough information to distinguish class 1.0 from class 2.0. The overall accuracy of the model is 76.47%, which means that it correctly predicts the class for 76.47% of the test set.\nThe macro avg and weighted avg for precision, recall, and f1-score provide a summary of the effectiveness of the model across the classes. The low macro avg for precision and f1-score indicates that one of the classes does not perform well, which we already know is class 1.0.\nThe f1-score is a harmonic mean of precision and recall and is a useful metric when you have classes that are imbalanced. In my case, the f1-score for class 1.0 [WOS] is 0.00, indicating poor performance for this class.\nGenerally, the Naive Bayes classifier for multivariate Bernoulli models proves to be an effective and reliable tool for classification tasks. Its ability to handle binary data, like our work method categories, contributes to its robustness and applicability in various analytical scenarios.\nTo create plots that visualize the performance of your BernoulliNB model, you would typically look at the confusion matrix, precision-recall, and possibly ROC curves. Below are examples of how you could generate each of these plots using matplotlib and scikit-learn:\n\nConfusion Matrix: Visualizes the correct and incorrect predictions compared to the actual values.\n\n\n\nCode\nfrom sklearn.metrics import confusion_matrix\nimport seaborn as sns\nimport matplotlib.pyplot as plt\n\n# Assuming y_test and y_pred are already defined from your BernoulliNB model\ncm = confusion_matrix(y_test, y_pred)\nsns.heatmap(cm, annot=True, fmt=\"d\")\nplt.title('Confusion Matrix for BernoulliNB Model')\nplt.xlabel('Predicted Labels')\nplt.ylabel('True Labels')\nplt.show()\n\n\n\n\n\nROC Curve: Plots the true positive rate against the false positive rate.\n\n\nCode\nfrom sklearn.metrics import roc_curve, auc\nfrom sklearn.metrics import RocCurveDisplay\nimport matplotlib.pyplot as plt\n\n# Adjust y_test to have binary labels 0 and 1\ny_test_binary = y_test.replace({1: 0, 2: 1})\n\n# Get predicted probabilities for the positive class (e.g., class 2)\ny_pred_prob = model.predict_proba(X_test)[:, 1]  # Index 1 for the probability of class 2\n\n# Calculate the ROC curve\nfpr, tpr, thresholds = roc_curve(y_test_binary, y_pred_prob)\n\n# Calculate the AUC (Area Under Curve)\nroc_auc = auc(fpr, tpr)\n\n# Plot the ROC curve\ndisp = RocCurveDisplay(fpr=fpr, tpr=tpr, roc_auc=roc_auc)\ndisp.plot()\nplt.title('ROC Curve for BernoulliNB Model')\nplt.show()\n\n\n\n\n\nClassification Report: Presents precision, recall, f1-score for each class.\n\n\nCode\nfrom sklearn.metrics import classification_report\nimport pandas as pd\n\nreport = classification_report(y_test, y_pred, output_dict=True)\ndf_report = pd.DataFrame(report).transpose()\n\ndf_report.drop(['accuracy'], inplace=True)  # Drop accuracy as it's not a class-specific metric\ndf_report.plot(kind='bar', figsize=(10, 7))\nplt.title('Classification Report for BernoulliNB Model')\nplt.ylabel('Score')\nplt.show()\n\n\n\n\n\nPlease note that in order to generate a ROC curve or Precision-Recall curve, you need the probability scores or decision function, not just the predicted labels. If y_pred contains only class labels, you would need to use the predict_proba or decision_function method of your classifier to obtain these scores.\nThese code snippets are intended to be run in your local Python environment, and you’ll need to ensure that y_test and y_pred are defined in your workspace after running your BernoulliNB model. If you encounter any issues with these plots or if you require further customization, feel free to ask for additional guidance.\nConclusions: Through our analysis, we aim to provide a clear picture of the current job market and its evolving nature. Whether it’s adapting to remote work setups or understanding the necessity of on-site roles, our study sheds light on these important trends.\nFinal Thoughts: As the world of work continues to change, we’re here to keep you informed and help you understand these shifts. Stay tuned for more insights and analyses on the changing job landscape!"

    "text": "The study and the attained dataset mainly focus on exploring the dynamic of the job market and its impact on the urban cityscape. Recent years marked a notable transformation in work methodologies. Many professionals are adopting the Work From Home (WFH) model, while many still adhere to traditional Work On Site (WOS) practices. My study delves into 20 distinct industry sectors, examining four unique classes of working methods and styles, as detailed below:\n\n\n\n1\nWorking On-Site [WOS]\n\n\n2\nWork From Home [WFH]\n\n\n\nThe data comes from a 2023 survey of 850 participants from various occupations. Participants were asked about their industry sector and working method. To respect data confidentiality, we’ve modified and anonymized the dataset. This ensures compliance with data privacy guidelines without affecting the overall analysis and insights.\n\n# Load necessary libraries\nimport pandas as pd\nimport matplotlib.pyplot as plt\nimport seaborn as sns\n\nStudy the relationship between nominal variables (Industry sector and Working Method)statistical analyses:\n1- Chi-Square Test of Independence: The Chi-Square test can be used to determine whether there is an association (relationship) between two categorical variables. In your case, you can use it to test if there is a relationship between Industry sector and Working Method. The null hypothesis (H0) is that the two variables are independent, and the alternative hypothesis (Ha) is that there is a significant association between them.\n\n# Load necessary libraries\nimport pandas as pd\nimport matplotlib.pyplot as plt\nimport seaborn as sns\nfrom scipy.stats import chi2_contingency\n\n2-Visualization: You can create visualizations to explore the relationship visually. For example, you can create a stacked bar chart to see how the distribution of Working Method varies across different Industry sectors. This can help you identify patterns or differences."
