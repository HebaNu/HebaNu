The dataset for this study is maily attained from a 2023 survey of 850 participants from various occupations in USA. The primary objective of these datasets is to facilitate an exploration of the job market's dynamics and their influence on urban landscapes. Specifically, participants in the study were queried about their industry sector and their preferred working method. ***To respect data confidentiality, we've modified and anonymized the dataset.*** This ensures compliance with data privacy guidelines without affecting the overall analysis.

Recent years marked a notable transformation in work methodologies. Many professionals are adopting the Work From Home (WFH) model, while many still adhere to traditional Work On Site (WOS) practices. My study delves into 20 distinct industry sectors, examining four unique classes of working methods, as detailed below:

|     |                                                                                                                                            |
|-----------|-------------------------------------------------------------|
| \#  | Working Method                                                                                                                             |
| 1   | Fully remote (working from home or another location)                                                                                       |
| 2   | Fully in-person (working at a physical office or location)                                                                                 |
| 3   | Hybrid, dominated by in-person work (spending the majority of your work time at a physical office or location, with some remote work)      |
| 4   | Hybrid, dominated by remote work (spending the majority of your work time working from home or another location, with some in-person work) |

In our survey ,twenty "industry sectors"or jobs are addressed based on the NAICS (North American Industry Classification System) to the 2-digit industry level. these jobs are as the following:

Essentially, we want to see if the way people work is related to the industry they work in.**, Chi-Square Test of Independence** is used to determine whether there is an association (relationship) between two categorical variables.

In our analysis, we're testing two ideas:

-   The null hypothesis (H0): There's no link between an employee's industry sector and their working method. They're independent of each other.

-   The alternative hypothesis (Ha): There is a significant link between the industry sector and the working method of employees.

```{python}
# Load necessary libraries
import pandas as pd
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt
import seaborn as sns
from scipy.stats import chi2_contingency

# Load your dataset without specifying encoding
data = pd.read_excel('Industry sector and working method.xlsx')

# Summary statistics for Industry sector
industry_stats = data[' Industry sector'].value_counts()

# Summary statistics for Working Method
method_stats = data['Working Method'].value_counts()

# Custom labels for Working Method
working_method_labels = ['Fully remote', 'Fully in-person', 'Hybrid, dominated by in-person work', 'Hybrid, dominated by remote work']

# Plotting
plt.figure(figsize=(12, 6))

# Industry Sector plot
plt.subplot(1, 2, 1)
sns.countplot(data=data, x=' Industry sector')
plt.title('Distribution of Industry Sectors')

# Working Method plot
plt.subplot(1, 2, 2)
sns.countplot(data=data, x='Working Method')
plt.title('Distribution of Working Methods')
plt.xticks(range(len(working_method_labels)), working_method_labels)  # Set custom labels

plt.tight_layout()
plt.show()

# Perform Chi-Square test of independence
contingency_table = pd.crosstab(data[' Industry sector'], data['Working Method'])
chi2, p, dof, expected = chi2_contingency(contingency_table)

# Check the p-value
if p < 0.05:
    print("There is a significant relationship between Industry sector and Working Method.")
else:
    print("There is no significant relationship between Industry sector and Working Method.")

# Display summary statistics
print("Summary statistics for Industry sector:")
print(industry_stats)

print("\nSummary statistics for Working Method:")
print(method_stats)


```

Alos, this plot is designed to visually explore the relationship between the industry sectors of employees and their working methods. It illustrates how the distribution of working methods varies across different industry sectors, allowing us to identify notable patterns or differences. Such visualizations are crucial for understanding the dynamics of the job market, particularly in the context of evolving work methodologies.

```{python}

crosstab = pd.crosstab(data[' Industry sector'], data['Working Method'])
crosstab.plot(kind='bar', stacked=True)

```

Additionally, the dataset contains several key elements that will be crucial for our upcoming statistical analyses. The most important elements include:
