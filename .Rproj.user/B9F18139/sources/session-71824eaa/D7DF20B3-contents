Hi,\
This is Heba Nusair, a Ph.D.Â Candidate in Landscape Architecture at Virginia Tech. I am passionate about promoting sustainability and resilience in cities, with expertise in modeling urban growth planning using Geospatial Information Science. I have a broad background in land analysis and evaluation, urban planning, and design using GIS, honed through years of extensive experience in the field.\
\
My current doctoral dissertation, 'Predicting the Impact of Shifting to Work-from-Home Paradigm on Urban Sprawl Using Agent-Based Model and Artificial Intelligence,' demonstrates my commitment to developing innovative solutions that address complex urban challenges on a large and medium city scale.

I'm here to share my findings with you through a series of engaging blog posts. In some of these, I've even used synthesized data sets to shed light on different facets of the outcomes. So, whether you're passionate about urban planning or just curious about the future of work, let's dive into the world of the changing nature of work and urban development.\
