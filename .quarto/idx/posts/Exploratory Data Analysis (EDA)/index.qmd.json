This survey, designed and executed by our research team, targeted participants from a wide range of occupations across the USA. Its focus was on examining the significant impact of remote work on urban development and residential choices. The participants provided their insights through a detailed questionnaire, which covered aspects such as working methods (remote or in-person) and their effects on housing location preferences. This rich data offers insights into behavioral patterns related to working modes, thereby illuminating the interplay between human activity and urban spatial dynamics.\n\n#### **Data Modification for Privacy and Educational Use:**\n\nIt's important to note that the datasets featured in these blog posts have been ***modified and synthesized for educational purposes**. They demonstrate various data analysis techniques but are not suitable for real-world applications due to these modifications.* In compliance with data privacy guidelines, we have anonymized the dataset to maintain the confidentiality of the survey participants. However, these modifications do not detract from the overall integrity and analytical value of the data.\n\n#### **Primary Objective of the Dataset:**\n\nThe main aim of this dataset is to explore the dynamics of the job market and their influence on urban landscapes. One of the key areas of inquiry in the survey was the industry sector and the preferred working method of the participants. By analyzing these elements, we gain a better understanding of current trends in the job market and how they shape urban environments.\n\n#### **Key Elements of the Dataset:**\n\nIn recent years, we've witnessed significant shifts in work methodologies. A growing number of professionals are embracing the Work From Home (WFH) approach, while a substantial segment continues to follow traditional Work On Site (WOS) practices. This study comprehensively covers 20 distinct industry sectors, focusing on four distinct categories of working methods. The details of these methods are outlined below:\n\n|     |                                                                                                                                            |\n|-----------|-------------------------------------------------------------|\n| \\#  | Working Method                                                                                                                             |\n| 1   | Fully remote (working from home or another location)                                                                                       |\n| 2   | Fully in-person (working at a physical office or location)                                                                                 |\n| 3   | Hybrid, dominated by in-person work (spending the majority of your work time at a physical office or location, with some remote work)      |\n| 4   | Hybrid, dominated by remote work (spending the majority of your work time working from home or another location, with some in-person work) |\n\nTwenty \"industry sectors\"or jobs are addressed based on the NAICS (North American Industry Classification System) to the 2-digit industry level. these jobs are as the following:\n\n|     | The number of industry sectors in NAICS | Description                                                               |\n|--------------|--------------------|---------------------------------------|\n| 1   | sector 11                               | Agriculture, Forestry, Fishing and Hunting                                |\n| 2   | sector 21                               | Mining, Quarrying, and Oil and Gas Extraction                             |\n| 3   | sector 22                               | Utilities                                                                 |\n| 4   | sector 23                               | Construction                                                              |\n| 5   | sector 31-33                            | Manufacturing                                                             |\n| 6   | sector 42                               | Wholesale Trade                                                           |\n| 7   | sector 44-45                            | Retail Trade                                                              |\n| 8   | sector 48-49                            | Transportation and Warehousing                                            |\n| 9   | sector 51                               | Information                                                               |\n| 10  | sector 52                               | Finance and Insurance                                                     |\n| 11  | sector 53                               | Real Estate and Rental and Leasing                                        |\n| 12  | sector 54                               | Professional, Scientific, and Technical Services                          |\n| 13  | sector 55                               | Management of Companies and Enterprises                                   |\n| 14  | sector 56                               | Administrative and Support and Waste Management and Remediation Services) |\n| 15  | sector 61                               | Educational Services                                                      |\n| 16  | sector 62                               | Health Care and Social Assistance                                         |\n| 17  | sector 71                               | Arts, Entertainment, and Recreation                                       |\n| 18  | sector 72                               | Accommodation and Food Services                                           |\n| 19  | sector 81                               | Other Services (except Public Administration)                             |\n| 20  | sector 92                               | Public Administration (not covered in economic census)                    |\n\nEssentially, we want to see if the way people work is related to the industry they work in.**, Chi-Square Test of Independence** is used to determine whether there is an association (relationship) between two categorical variables.\n\nIn our analysis, we're testing two ideas:\n\n-   The null hypothesis (H0): There's no link between an employee's industry sector and their working method.

They're independent of each other.\n\n-   The alternative hypothesis (Ha): There is a significant link between the industry sector and the working method of employees.\n\n```{python}\n# Load necessary libraries\nimport pandas as pd\nimport matplotlib.pyplot as plt\nimport seaborn as sns\nfrom scipy.stats import chi2_contingency\n\n# Load your dataset without specifying encoding\ndata = pd.read_excel('Industry sector and working method.xlsx')\n\n# Summary statistics for Industry sector\nindustry_stats = data[' Industry sector'].value_counts()\n\n# Summary statistics for Working Method\nmethod_stats = data['Working Method'].value_counts()\n\n# Custom labels for Working Method, with line breaks\nworking_method_labels = [\n    'Fully remote\\n(working from home or another location)',\n    'Fully in-person\\n(working at a physical office or location)',\n    'Hybrid, dominated by\\nin-person work',\n    'Hybrid, dominated by\\nremote work'\n]\n\n# Plotting with adjusted figure size and subplot parameters\nplt.figure(figsize=(14, 8))  # Further increase the figure size\n\n# Industry Sector plot\nplt.subplot(1, 2, 1)\nsns.countplot(data=data, x=' Industry sector')\nplt.title('Distribution of Industry Sectors')\n\n\n# Plotting with horizontal bar chart\nplt.figure(figsize=(6, 5))  # Adjust figure size for horizontal plot\n\n# Working Method plot (horizontal)\nsns.countplot(data=data, y='Working Method')\nplt.title('Distribution of Working Methods')\nplt.yticks(range(len(working_method_labels)), working_method_labels)  # Set y-axis labels\n\nplt.tight_layout()\nplt.show()\n\n\n```\n\nAlos, this plot is designed to visually explore the relationship between the industry sectors of employees and their working methods. It illustrates how the distribution of working methods varies across different industry sectors, allowing us to identify notable patterns or differences. Such visualizations are crucial for understanding the dynamics of the job market, particularly in the context of evolving work methodologies.\n\n```{python}\n\ncrosstab = pd.crosstab(data[' Industry sector'], data['Working Method'])\ncrosstab.plot(kind='bar', stacked=True)\n\n```\n\nAdditionally, the dataset contains several key elements that will be crucial for our upcoming statistical analyses.
