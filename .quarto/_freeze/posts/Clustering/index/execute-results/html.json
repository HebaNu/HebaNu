Geographic clustering, a powerful analytical tool, allows us to uncover these stories by revealing the invisible patterns of human settlement and organization within these spaces. This analysis goes beyond mere numbers and dots on a map; it provides us with the insight to understand how populations distribute themselves across regions and how this distribution may affect and be affected by socio-economic factors.\n\n![](RoanokeAndSalemCities.JPG)\n\nIn this exploration, we dive into the spatial heart of Roanoke and Salem, employing a data-driven approach to demystify the geographic distribution and density of home locations. By utilizing the K-Means clustering technique, we aim to transcend the traditional narratives of urban planning and offer a unique lens through which we can comprehend the dynamics of these cities.\n\nJoin me on this cartographic journey as we navigate through the coordinates, interpret the clusters, and stitch together the fabric of these communities, one cluster at a time.\n\n::: {.cell execution_count=1}\n``` {.python .cell-code}\nimport pandas as pd\nfrom sklearn.cluster import KMeans\nimport matplotlib.pyplot as plt\n\n# Load the data\ndf = pd.read_csv('xy2.csv')\n\n# Assuming you're using 3 clusters (adjust as necessary)\nkmeans = KMeans(n_clusters=3, random_state=0)\nkmeans.fit(df[['X', 'Y']])\n\n# Assign the cluster labels to the DataFrame\ndf['Cluster'] = kmeans.labels_\n\n# Plotting the clusters\nplt.scatter(df['X'], df['Y'], c=df['Cluster'], cmap='viridis')\nplt.title('K-Means Clustering of Home Locations')\nplt.xlabel('X (Longitude)')\nplt.ylabel('Y (Latitude)')\nplt.colorbar(label='Cluster Label')\nplt.show()\n```\n\n::: {.cell-output .cell-output-stderr}\n```\nC:\\Users\\NUSAI\\anaconda3\\Lib\\site-packages\\sklearn\\cluster\\_kmeans.py:1412: FutureWarning:\n\nThe default value of `n_init` will change from 10 to 'auto' in 1.4.
