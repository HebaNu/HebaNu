Here's a breakdown of what it means:\n\nClassification Report: This report shows several metrics for each class in your target variable (current job), which seems to have four classes (1.0, 2.0, 3.0, 4.0). The metrics are:\n\nPrecision: The ratio of correctly predicted positive observations to the total predicted positives. Higher precision relates to a lower false positive rate.\nRecall (Sensitivity): The ratio of correctly predicted positive observations to all observations in the actual class.\nF1-Score: The weighted average of Precision and Recall. An F1-Score reaches its best value at 1 (perfect precision and recall) and worst at 0.\nSupport: The number of actual occurrences of the class in the specified dataset.\nAccuracy: This is the ratio of correctly predicted observations to the total observations. An accuracy of 0.4470588235294118 means that about 44.71% of your model's predictions are correct.\n\nInterpretation\nYour model shows varying performance across different classes. For instance, it performs relatively better for class 2.0 than for other classes.\nThe accuracy is 44.71%, which suggests that the model correctly predicts the class about 45% of the time. This is not particularly high, indicating there's room for improvement.\nThe macro average and weighted average scores are relatively low, especially in precision and F1-score, which suggests that the model's performance is not consistent across all classes.\n\n",
