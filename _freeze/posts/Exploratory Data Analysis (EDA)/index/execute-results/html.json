The primary objective of these datasets is to facilitate an exploration of the job market's dynamics and their influence on urban landscapes. Specifically, participants in the study were queried about their industry sector and their preferred working method. ***To respect data confidentiality, we've modified and anonymized the dataset.*** This ensures compliance with data privacy guidelines without affecting the overall analysis.\n\nRecent years marked a notable transformation in work methodologies. Many professionals are adopting the Work From Home (WFH) model, while many still adhere to traditional Work On Site (WOS) practices. My study delves into 20 distinct industry sectors, examining four unique classes of working methods, as detailed below:\n\n|     |                                                                                                                                            |\n|-----------|-------------------------------------------------------------|\n| \\#  | Working Method                                                                                                                             |\n| 1   | Fully remote (working from home or another location)                                                                                       |\n| 2   | Fully in-person (working at a physical office or location)                                                                                 |\n| 3   | Hybrid, dominated by in-person work (spending the majority of your work time at a physical office or location, with some remote work)      |\n| 4   | Hybrid, dominated by remote work (spending the majority of your work time working from home or another location, with some in-person work) |\n\nIn our survey ,twenty \"industry sectors\"or jobs are addressed based on the NAICS (North American Industry Classification System) to the 2-digit industry level. these jobs are as the following:\n\n| The number of industry sectors in NAICS | Description                                                               |\n|--------------------------|----------------------------------------------|\n| sector 11                               | Agriculture, Forestry, Fishing and Hunting                                |\n| sector 21                               | Mining, Quarrying, and Oil and Gas Extraction                             |\n| sector 22                               | Utilities                                                                 |\n| sector 23                               | Construction                                                              |\n| sector 31-33                            | Manufacturing                                                             |\n| sector 42                               | Wholesale Trade                                                           |\n| sector 44-45                            | Retail Trade                                                              |\n| sector 48-49                            | Transportation and Warehousing                                            |\n| sector 51                               | Information                                                               |\n| sector 52                               | Finance and Insurance                                                     |\n| sector 53                               | Real Estate and Rental and Leasing                                        |\n| sector 54                               | Professional, Scientific, and Technical Services                          |\n| sector 55                               | Management of Companies and Enterprises                                   |\n| sector 56                               | Administrative and Support and Waste Management and Remediation Services) |\n| sector 61                               | Educational Services                                                      |\n| sector 62                               | Health Care and Social Assistance                                         |\n| sector 71                               | Arts, Entertainment, and Recreation                                       |\n| sector 72                               | Accommodation and Food Services                                           |\n| sector 81                               | Other Services (except Public Administration)                             |\n| sector 92                               | Public Administration (not covered in economic census)                    |\n\nEssentially, we want to see if the way people work is related to the industry they work in.**, Chi-Square Test of Independence** is used to determine whether there is an association (relationship) between two categorical variables.\n\nIn our analysis, we're testing two ideas:\n\n-   The null hypothesis (H0): There's no link between an employee's industry sector and their working method. They're independent of each other.\n\n-   The alternative hypothesis (Ha): There is a significant link between the industry sector and the working method of employees.\n\n::: {.cell execution_count=1}\n``` {.python .cell-code}\n# Load necessary libraries\nimport pandas as pd\nimport matplotlib.pyplot as plt\nimport seaborn as sns\nfrom scipy.stats import chi2_contingency\n\n# Load your dataset without specifying encoding\ndata = pd.read_excel('Industry sector and working method.xlsx')\n\n# Summary statistics for Industry sector\nindustry_stats = data[' Industry sector'].value_counts()\n\n# Summary statistics for Working Method\nmethod_stats = data['Working Method'].value_counts()\n\n# Custom labels for Working Method, with line breaks\nworking_method_labels = [\n    'Fully remote\\n(working from home or another location)',\n    'Fully in-person\\n(working at a physical office or location)',\n    'Hybrid, dominated by\\nin-person work',\n    'Hybrid, dominated by\\nremote work'\n]\n\n# Plotting with adjusted figure size and subplot parameters\nplt.figure(figsize=(18, 8))  # Further increase the figure size\n\n# Industry Sector plot\nplt.subplot(1, 2, 1)\nsns.countplot(data=data, x=' Industry sector')\nplt.title('Distribution of Industry Sectors')\n\n# Working Method plot\nplt.subplot(1, 2, 2)\nsns.countplot(data=data, x='Working Method')\nplt.title('Distribution of Working Methods')\nplt.xticks(range(len(working_method_labels)), working_method_labels)  # Updated labels\n\n# Plotting with horizontal bar chart\nplt.figure(figsize=(12, 8))  # Adjust figure size for horizontal plot\n\n# Working Method plot (horizontal)\nsns.countplot(data=data, y='Working Method')\nplt.title('Distribution of Working Methods')\nplt.yticks(range(len(working_method_labels)), working_method_labels)  # Set y-axis labels\n\nplt.tight_layout()\nplt.show()\n\n```\n\n::: {.cell-output .cell-output-display}\n![](index_files/figure-html/cell-2-output-1.png){width=1403 height=686}\n:::\n\n::: {.cell-output .cell-output-display}\n![](index_files/figure-html/cell-2-output-2.png){width=1140 height=756}\n:::\n:::\n\n\nAlos, this plot is designed to visually explore the relationship between the industry sectors of employees and their working methods.
