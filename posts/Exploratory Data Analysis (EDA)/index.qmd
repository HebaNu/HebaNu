The study and the attained dataset mainly focus on exploring the dynamic of the job market and its impact on the urban cityscape. Recent years marked a notable transformation in work methodologies. Many professionals are adopting the Work From Home (WFH) model, while many still adhere to traditional Work On Site (WOS) practices. My study delves into 20 distinct industry sectors, examining four unique classes of working methods and styles, as detailed below:

|     |                                                                                                                                            |
|-----|--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
|     | Working Method                                                                                                                             |
| 1   | Fully remote (working from home or another location)                                                                                       |
| 2   | Fully in-person (working at a physical office or location)                                                                                 |
| 3   | Hybrid, dominated by in-person work (spending the majority of your work time at a physical office or location, with some remote work)      |
| 4   | Hybrid, dominated by remote work (spending the majority of your work time working from home or another location, with some in-person work) |

The data comes from a 2023 survey of 850 participants from various occupations in USA. Participants were asked about their industry sector and working method. ***To respect data confidentiality, we've modified and anonymized the dataset.*** This ensures compliance with data privacy guidelines without affecting the overall analysis and insights.

```{python}
# Load necessary libraries
import pandas as pd
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt
import seaborn as sns

# Load your dataset without specifying encoding
data = pd.read_excel('Updated dataset_NOV12.xlsx')

# Summary statistics for Industry sector
industry_stats = data[''].value_counts()

# Summary statistics for Working Method
method_stats = data['Working Method'].value_counts()

# Plotting
plt.figure(figsize=(12, 6))
plt.subplot(1, 2, 1)
sns.countplot(data=data, x=' Industry sector')
plt.title('Distribution of Industry Sectors')

plt.subplot(1, 2, 2)
sns.countplot(data=data, x='Working Method')
plt.title('Distribution of Working Methods')

plt.tight_layout()
plt.show()

# Display summary statistics
print("Summary statistics for Industry sector:")
print(industry_stats)

print("\nSummary statistics for Working Method:")
print(method_stats)

```

**Study the relationship between nominal variables (Industry sector and Working Method)statistical analyses:**\
1- **Chi-Square Test of Independence**: The Chi-Square test can be used to determine whether there is an association (relationship) between two categorical variables. In your case, you can use it to test if there is a relationship between Industry sector and Working Method. The null hypothesis (H0) is that the two variables are independent, and the alternative hypothesis (Ha) is that there is a significant association between them.

```{python}

# Load necessary libraries
import pandas as pd
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt
import seaborn as sns
from scipy.stats import chi2_contingency

# Load your dataset without specifying encoding
data = pd.read_excel('CategoricalNB.xlsx')


from scipy.stats import chi2_contingency

# Summary statistics for Industry sector
industry_stats = data[' Industry sector'].value_counts()

# Summary statistics for Working Method
method_stats = data['Working Method'].value_counts()

# Plotting
plt.figure(figsize=(12, 6))
plt.subplot(1, 2, 1)
sns.countplot(data=data, x=' Industry sector')
plt.title('Distribution of Industry Sectors')

plt.subplot(1, 2, 2)
sns.countplot(data=data, x='Working Method')
plt.title('Distribution of Working Methods')

plt.tight_layout()
plt.show()

# Perform Chi-Square test of independence
contingency_table = pd.crosstab(data[' Industry sector'], data['Working Method'])
chi2, p, dof, expected = chi2_contingency(contingency_table)

# Check the p-value
if p < 0.05:
    print("There is a significant relationship between Industry sector and Working Method.")
else:
    print("There is no significant relationship between Industry sector and Working Method.")

# Display summary statistics
print("Summary statistics for Industry sector:")
print(industry_stats)

print("\nSummary statistics for Working Method:")
print(method_stats)

```

**2-Visualization**: You can create visualizations to explore the relationship visually. For example, you can create a stacked bar chart to see how the distribution of Working Method varies across different Industry sectors. This can help you identify patterns or differences.

```{python}
crosstab = pd.crosstab(data[' Industry sector'], data['Working Method'])
crosstab.plot(kind='bar', stacked=True)

```
